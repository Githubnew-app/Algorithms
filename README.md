## Tasks
- Test environment

  - To create a project for checking homework tasks. Each task is presented as a set of files with a description of the task ("**problem.txt**"), set of test cases ("**test.*N*.in**", where ***N*** is the number of the test case), and an appropriate set of answers ("**test.*N*.out**"). A solution for a task can be added to the project as a separate class(es). It should be able to add new tasks and appropriate solutions to the project. The 'test environment' should allow checking a solution and show whether test cases passed or not. 
  - To check the proper functioning of the 'test environment' via sample of task '**0.String**'.

- Incantations *(for fun)*
  - To figure out what incantation (a single line function F(x, y)) should lead to an expected image.
